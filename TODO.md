# plans
the plans for this are: (todo: fill this out)

## Multiversal (Layer 5)
this layer is reached by trying to "save" the game during the END sequence, a popup will occur telling the player they can't save this reality, and here a different progression starts

you gain multiversal remains every reset which you can use to buy upgrades (also requires god particles)

oh you also have multiversal milestones which is based on total remains

celestials here are:
- **thienum**: celestial of realms, has alternative universes (AUs) which has very different game mechanics
- **knull**: celestial of darkness, hidden and mysterious, you have to search throughout the game to find his pieces
- **hevi**: celestial of heaven, quests to buff neglected features

some other stuff here are:
- multiversal dimensions, bought using remains and generates god particles (which can also be used to purchase additional dimensions)
  - could also be called accelerational dimension, which produces accelerons instead and god particles are gained somewhere else
- acceleration, which speeds up how fast things speeds up (you know like the relationship between acceleration and velocity)
  - you use accelerons for this
  - upgrades, to make accelerons boost other game mechanics (eg. replicanti, gamespeed)
- spatial studies, unlocked after some quest from hevi, you use space theorems to purchase these instead of time theorems (hence the name)
  - a requirement for the next layer, this also removes the cap from some stuff

## Atomics (Layer 6)
at the end of the multiversal section of spatial studies, you will be able to unlock the atomic layer by some spatial study

## Quantum (Layer 7)
quantum physics stuff can be unlocked here by some other spatial study

## Meta (Layer 8)
you reach this by reaching e9e15 antimatter in a big rip

## Ascension (Layer 9)
you reach this by, idk

## Omnisity (Layer 10)
yeah i definitely don't know
