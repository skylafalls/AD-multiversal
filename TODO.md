# plans
the plans for this are: (todo: fill this out)

## Multiversal (Layer 5)
this layer is reached by trying to "save" the game during the END sequence, a popup will occur telling the player they can't save this reality, and here a different progression starts

you gain multiversal remains every reset which you can use to buy upgrades (also requires god particles)

oh you also have multiversal milestones which is based on total remains

celestials here are:
- **thienum**: celestial of realms, has alternative universes (AUs) which has very different game mechanics
- **knull**: celestial of darkness, hidden and mysterious, you have to search throughout the game to find his pieces
- **hevi**: celestial of heaven, quests to buff neglected features

some other stuff here are:
- multiversal dimensions, bought using remains and generates god particles (which can also be used to purchase additional dimensions)
  - could also be called accelerational dimension, which produces accelerons instead and god particles are gained somewhere else
- acceleration, which speeds up how fast things speeds up (you know like the relationship between acceleration and velocity)
  - you use accelerons for this
  - upgrades, to make accelerons boost other game mechanics (eg. replicanti, gamespeed)
- spatial studies, unlocked after some quest from hevi, you use space theorems to purchase these instead of time theorems (hence the name)
  - a requirement for the next layer, this also removes the cap from some stuff

## Atomics (Layer 6)
at the end of the multiversal section of spatial studies, you will be able to unlock the atomic layer by some spatial study

note: i have no idea if you unlock meta dimensions or not, it'll probably be late-atomics you get something similar to meta dimensions's buff

### quarks
on atomic resets you gain various different quark types which are:
- up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top

quarks also has an associated color (red, green, blue) which the product of the all the quark types in the color boosts a certain layer:
- red => infinity
- green => reality
- blue => eternity

basically, the color determines which layer the quark boosts with its specific type determining the well, specific type.

each color has a certain color charge, which is boosted by the major currency from the layer associated with the color. these are:
- reality machines => green charge
- replicanti => red charge
- time shards => blue charge

these charges makes the colored quark effects stronger, acting as a positive feedback loop.

### gluons
gluons are gained by tangling a certain pair of quark colors (exact formula unknown)

these do not work like [NG+3](https://raw.githack.com/aarextiaokhiao/NG-plus-3/v2.3.1-Ghost-R/index.html) gluons, instead they work more like [NG+3R](https://aarextiaokhiao.github.io/IvarK.github.io/) gluons which means instead of purchasing upgrades, you can unlock boosts by spending some currency (unknown currency currently).

each boost has a unique effect and an associated color, which means the boost only applies if you tangle a certain color pair (eg. only red boosts are activated by red-blue or green-red gluon pairs)

unlike [NG+3R](https://aarextiaokhiao.github.io/IvarK.github.io/), you cannot "master" boosts, you can only unlock new ones (a maximum of 12 boosts), so you must be smart when pairing color gluons.

gluon pairs also affects color charges. mainly, entangling a color pair will boost the charge gain for that pair while diminishing the charge's effect for the third color that wasn't tangled.

### pair production
you can discharge antimatter galaxies to create a pair of electrons and positrons.

discharging galaxies nullifies the effect of galaxies (AGs - dAGs) to generate a pair of the two charged particles, in return for these effects:
- electrons boosts the per-10 antimatter dimension multiplier (exponentially)
- positrons boosts the dimension boost base multiplier (also exponentially)

## Quantum (Layer 7)
quantum physics stuff can be unlocked here by some other spatial study

## Meta (Layer 8)
you reach this by reaching e9e15 antimatter in a big rip

## Ascension (Layer 9)
you reach this by, idk

## Omnisity (Layer 10)
yeah i definitely don't know
